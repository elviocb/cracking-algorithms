/* There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: 
  - insert a character
  - remove a character
  - replace a character
  Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one-edit or zero-edit away.

  Example:

  force  fork  --> true
  force  forc  --> true
  forces force --> true
  force  fark  --> false
